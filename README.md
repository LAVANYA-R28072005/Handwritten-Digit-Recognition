# üìù Project Title:
Handwritten Digit Recognition 

# üìö Project Description:
This project builds a system that:
1. Trains a CNN model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.
2. Tests and evaluates the model‚Äôs performance.
3. Deploys the model using a simple GUI with Tkinter where users can draw digits and get predictions.

Handwritten-Digit-Recognition: 
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to build an intelligent system that can automatically recognize digits (0‚Äì9) written by hand.The project also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to draw digits and instantly receive predictions.

# üèóÔ∏è Project Steps:
1. Import Libraries
TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tkinter, PIL, etc.

2. Load and Preprocess Data
 * Load the MNIST dataset.
 * Normalize images (pixel values 0-255 ‚Üí 0-1).
 * Reshape images to (28, 28, 1) for CNN input.

3. Build the CNN Model
Layers:
* Conv2D ‚Üí MaxPooling2D ‚Üí Conv2D ‚Üí MaxPooling2D ‚Üí Conv2D
* Flatten
* Dense(64)
* Dense(10) with softmax activation (for multi-class classification)

4. Compile the Model
  * Optimizer: Adam
  * Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
  * Metric: Accuracy

5. Train the Model
  * Trained for 20 epochs with validation on test data.

6. Evaluate the Model
   * Test accuracy is printed.
   * Predictions are plotted for individual samples and multiple samples.

7. Save the Model
   * Model saved as: mnist_digit_recognition_model.h5

8. GUI Application
   * Built using Tkinter.
   * You can draw a digit on a white canvas.
 Two buttons:
  - Predict (to show the model‚Äôs prediction)
  - Clear (to reset the canvas)

‚ú® Features:
- Interactive notebook with visualization.
- Interactive slider to browse predictions on test images.
- Deployable GUI using Tkinter.

‚ö° Quick Summary:
* ‚úÖ Data: MNIST handwritten digits
* ‚úÖ Model: CNN with 3 Convolutions + Dense layers
* ‚úÖ Deployment: Tkinter GUI + Canvas drawing

- Disadvantage:
  * Only we can Predict from 0-9.
  * It can predict Only Single digits.
